        I am a Computer Engineering graduate, and my interest in web interface
        development has led me to specialize in the frontend field. I have built
        a strong technical foundation in modern technologies such as React,
        TypeScript, JavaScript, and Sass. I continuously work on improving
        myself in areas such as frontend architectures, component-based
        structures, responsive design, and testing processes. I stay up-to-date
        with the latest technologies and industry practices to expand my
        technical knowledge. As a developer who values detail, is eager to
        learn, and prioritizes user experience, I am shaping my career along a
        frontend-focused path.
